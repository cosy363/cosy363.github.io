## 2. 사전 요구 사항

이 프로젝트를 실행하기 위해서는 다음 도구들이 설치되어 있어야 합니다.

- **Node.js**: v18 이상 권장
- **pnpm**: 패키지 매니저

## 3. 설치 (Installation)

프로젝트 의존성을 설치합니다.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 4. 개발 서버 실행 (Development)

로컬 개발 서버를 실행합니다.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

실행 후 브라우저에서 `http://localhost:4321` (또는 터미널에 표시된 주소)로 접속하여 확인할 수 있습니다.

## 5. 빌드 (Build)

프로덕션 배포를 위해 프로젝트를 빌드합니다.

```bash
pnpm build
```

빌드된 결과물은 `dist/` 디렉토리에 생성됩니다.

## 6. 미리보기 (Preview)

빌드된 결과물을 로컬에서 미리 확인합니다.

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## 7. 기타 명령어

- **Lint**: 코드 스타일 검사
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```
- **Format**: 코드 포맷팅
  ```bash
  pnpm format
  ```
- **Check**: Astro 타입 체크
  ```bash
  pnpm check

Commands
Replace pnpm with your choice of npm / yarn

Command	Action
pnpm install	Installs dependencies
pnpm dev	Starts local dev server at localhost:3000
pnpm build	Build your production site to ./dist/
pnpm postbuild	Pagefind script to build the static search of your blog posts
pnpm preview	Preview your build locally, before deploying
pnpm sync	Generate types based on your config in src/content/config.ts
Configure
Edit the template's config file src/site.config.ts
Important: set the url property with your own domain.
Modify the settings for markdown code blocks, generated by Expressive Code. Astro Cactus has both a dark (dracula) and light (github-light) theme. You can find more options @ expressive-code.
Update file astro.config.ts
astro-webmanifest options
Replace & update files within the /public folder:
icon.svg - used as the source to create favicons & manifest icons
social-card.png - used as the default og:image
Modify file src/styles/global.css with your own light and dark styles, and customise Tailwind's theme settings.
Edit social links in src/components/SocialList.astro to add/replace your media profile. Icons can be found @ icones.js.org, per Astro Icon's instructions.
Create/edit posts & notes for your blog within src/content/post/ & src/content/note/ with .md/mdx file(s). See below for more details.
Read this post for adding webmentions to your site.
Add any custom Tag pages for related blog posts in /src/content/tag/, ensuring that the file name is the same as the tag.
OG Image:
If you would like to change the style of the generated image the Satori library creates, open up src/pages/og-image/[slug].png.ts to the markup function where you can edit the html/tailwind-classes as necessary. You can use this playground to aid your design.
You can also create your own og images and skip satori generating it for you by adding an ogImage property in the frontmatter with a link to the asset, an example can be found in src/content/post/social-image.md. More info on frontmatter can be found below
Optional:
Fonts: This theme sets the body element to the font family font-mono, in src/layouts/Base.astro on the <body>. You can change fonts by removing the variant font-mono, after which TailwindCSS will default to the font-sans font family stack.
Updating
If you've forked the template, you can sync the fork with your own project, remembering to not click Discard Changes as you will lose your own.

If you have a template repository, you can add this template as a remote, as discussed here.

Adding posts, notes, and tags
This theme uses Content Collections to organise local Markdown and MDX files, as well as type-checking frontmatter with a schema -> src/content.config.ts.

Adding a post/note/tag is as simple as adding your .md(x) files to either src/content/post, src/content/note, and src/content/tag folders, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url.

The Tag collection allows you to override the content for generated tag pages. For example the template includes src/content/tag/test.md which overrides the content shown in your-domain.com/tags/test.

Note For a tag page to work, the file name (src/content/tag/*) must also be in a post's tags frontmatter.

The posts/notes/tags included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the Astro docs has a detailed section on markdown pages.

Post Frontmatter
Property (* required)	Description
title *	Self explanatory. Used as the text link to the post, the h1 on the posts' page, and the pages title property. Has a max length of 60 chars, set in src/content/config.ts
description *	Similar to above, used as the seo description property. Has a min length of 50 and a max length of 160 chars, set in the post schema.
publishDate *	Again pretty simple. To change the date format/locale, currently en-GB, update the date option in src/site.config.ts. Note you can also pass additional options to the component <FormattedDate> if required.
updatedDate	This is an optional date representing when a post has been updated, in the same format as the publishDate.
tags	Tags are optional with any created post. Any new tag(s) will be shown in your-domain.com/posts & your-domain.com/tags, and generate the page(s) your-domain.com/tags/[yourTag]
coverImage	This is an optional object that will add a cover image to the top of a post. Include both a src: "path-to-image" and alt: "image alt". You can view an example in src/content/post/cover-image.md.
ogImage	This is an optional property. An OG Image will be generated automatically for every post where this property isn't provided. If you would like to create your own for a specific post, include this property and a link to your image, the theme will then skip automatically generating one.
draft	This is an optional property as it is set to false by default in the schema. By adding true, the post will be filtered out of the production build in a number of places, inc. getAllPosts() calls, og-images, rss feeds, and generated page[s]. You can view an example in src/content/post/draft-post.md
Note Frontmatter
Property (* required)	Description
title *	Used as the link text to the note, the pages title property, and the h1 of said note page. Has a max length 60 chars.
description	Optional. Used for the head meta description property.
publishDate *	ISO 8601 format with offsets allowed.
Tag Frontmatter
Property (* required)	Description
title	Optional. Used as the h1 on the tags' page, and the pages title property. Has a max length of 60 chars.
description	Optional. Used for the head meta description and the first paragraph under the h1.
Frontmatter snippets
Astro Cactus includes a helpful VSCode snippet which creates a frontmatter 'stub' for posts and note's, found here -> .vscode/post.code-snippets. Start typing the word frontmatter on your newly created .md(x) file to trigger it. Visual Studio Code snippets appear in IntelliSense via (⌃Space) on mac, (Ctrl+Space) on windows.

Pagefind search
This integration brings a static search feature for searching blog posts and notes. In its current form, pagefind only works once the site has been built. This theme adds a postbuild script that should be run after Astro has built the site. You can preview locally by running both build && postbuild.

Search results only includes pages from posts and notes. If you would like to include other/all your pages, remove/re-locate the attribute data-pagefind-body to the article tag found in src/layouts/BlogPost.astro and src/components/note/Note.astro.

It also allows you to filter posts by tags added in the frontmatter of blog posts. If you would rather remove this, remove the data attribute data-pagefind-filter="tag" from the link in src/components/blog/Masthead.astro.

If you would rather not include this integration, simply remove the component src/components/Search.astro, and uninstall both @pagefind/default-ui & pagefind from package.json. You will also need to remove the postbuild script from here as well.

You can reduce the initial css payload of your css, as demonstrated here, by lazy loading the web components styles.

Analytics
You may want to track the number of visitors you receive to your blog/website in order to understand trends and popular posts/pages you've created. There are a number of providers out there one could use, including web hosts such as vercel, netlify, and cloudflare.

This theme/template doesn't include a specific solution due to there being a number of use cases and/or options which some people may or may not use.

You may be asked to included a snippet inside the HEAD tag of your website when setting it up, which can be found in src/layouts/Base.astro. Alternatively, you can add the snippet in src/components/BaseHead.astro.

Deploy
Astro docs has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.

By default the site will be built (see Commands section above) to a /dist directory.
